# Building ChurchTools-Plugins

With this project you get a boilerplate for building your own plugin for [ChurchTools](https://www.church.tools).

## Configuration

In the `.env` you can configure the necessary constants to start with your project. With that, the ChurchTools-Client is ready to go and you can start using the ChurchTools-API. Make sure you do not store credentials in this file, if so include it in `.gitignore`!

Also installed is pinia and vue-router, prettier and eslint.

So: Happy coding

For questions concerning the API reach out in the [Forum](https://forum.church.tools).
